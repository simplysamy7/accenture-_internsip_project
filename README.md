# accenture_internsip_project
This is a project I had done as part of virtual internship from Accenture through Forage. It is the analysis of a dataset of a fictional Social Media comaony called "Social Buzz" using Google Sheets and Google Slides. It identifies the most popular content categories, month with the highest content, reaction scores for each contnet, the most popular reaction types and other similar useful metrics.
Tools, functions used: Google Slides and Google Sheets. Pivot tables, pivot charts.

This is the project details info: Social Buzz is a fast growing Social Media Company. It needs to quickly adapt to its global scale.

Accenture has begun a 3 month Project with them to accomplish the 3 tasks:

- An audit of their big data practice 
- Recommendations for a successful IPO 
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity
